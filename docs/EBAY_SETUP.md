# eBay API Setup Guide

This guide walks you through connecting SnapCard to the eBay API — from developer registration to your first live listing.

---

## Overview

SnapCard uses the eBay Trading API to publish Pokemon card listings on your behalf. The integration involves two sides:

- **You (developer)** — register for API credentials and configure SnapCard
- **Your users (card sellers)** — connect their eBay seller account via a one-click OAuth flow

---

## Step 1: Register as an eBay Developer

1. Go to [developer.ebay.com](https://developer.ebay.com/join)
2. Click **Join** and create a **Business** account
3. Fill in your organization details
4. Verify your email address
5. Wait for approval — **sandbox keys are available immediately**, production keys may take 1-2 business days

---

## Step 2: Create Your Application Keyset

1. Log in to [developer.ebay.com](https://developer.ebay.com)
2. Go to **My Account** → **Application Keys**
3. Click **Create a keyset** under the **Sandbox** tab first
4. eBay will generate three values — save them:

| eBay Portal Label | SnapCard Env Var | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Client ID | `EBAY_APP_ID` | Your application identifier |
| Client Secret | `EBAY_CERT_ID` | Your application secret |
| Dev ID | `EBAY_DEV_ID` | Your developer account ID (shared across apps) |

---

## Step 3: Configure OAuth Redirect URI (RuName)

eBay calls the redirect URI a **RuName** (Redirect URL Name). This is where eBay sends users back after they authorize your app.

1. On the Application Keys page, click **User Tokens** under your keyset
2. Select **Auth Accepted URL** and add:
   - **Sandbox**: `http://localhost:5173/auth/ebay-callback`
   - **Production**: `https://snapcard.ca/auth/ebay-callback`
3. eBay generates a **RuName string** (looks like `Your_Brand_Name-YourApp-SBX-abc123`)
4. Copy this RuName string — this is your `EBAY_REDIRECT_URI`

> **Important:** `EBAY_REDIRECT_URI` is the RuName string, NOT the URL itself. eBay's OAuth endpoint uses the RuName to look up your registered callback URL.

---

## Step 4: Set Environment Variables

### Local Development (`backend/.env`)

Add these to your `backend/.env` file:

```env
# eBay API credentials
EBAY_APP_ID=your-client-id
EBAY_CERT_ID=your-client-secret
EBAY_DEV_ID=your-dev-id
EBAY_REDIRECT_URI=Your_RuName_String

# eBay environment config
EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox        # "sandbox" or "production"
EBAY_SITE_ID=2                  # 2 = Canada (eBay.ca)
EBAY_MOCK_MODE=false            # Set to "true" to skip real eBay API calls
```

### Production (Railway Dashboard)

Add the same variables in your Railway project's **Variables** tab. Make sure `EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=production` when you're ready to go live.

---

## Step 5: Test with Sandbox

1. Start the backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Create a test account or log in
4. Go through Onboarding → click **Connect eBay Account**
5. You'll be redirected to eBay's **sandbox** sign-in page
6. Sign in with a sandbox test account (create one at [sandbox.ebay.com](https://sandbox.ebay.com))
7. Approve the permissions → you'll return to SnapCard
8. Create a test listing and publish it
9. Verify in Supabase: check the `ebay_accounts` table for the token row

### Sandbox Notes
- Sandbox uses separate URLs (`api.sandbox.ebay.com`) — handled automatically by `EBAY_ENVIRONMENT`
- Test accounts have $500,000 in fake funds (refreshed weekly)
- Sandbox listings aren't real — they won't appear on eBay.com/eBay.ca
- Rate limit: 5,000 calls/day

---

## Step 6: Switch to Production

### 6A: Get Production Keyset

1. Go to **Application Keys** → **Production** tab
2. Click **Create a keyset**
3. eBay may require you to complete the **Marketplace Account Deletion Notification** requirement first (see below)
4. Add your production redirect URI: `https://snapcard.ca/auth/ebay-callback`
5. Copy the production RuName

### 6B: Marketplace Account Deletion Notification

eBay requires apps that store user data to handle account deletion requests. SnapCard stores eBay tokens in the `ebay_accounts` table, so you need to set this up:

1. In the eBay developer portal, go to your application's **Account Deletion** settings
2. Set the notification endpoint URL to: `https://snapcard-production-e7e7.up.railway.app/api/marketplace-account-deletion`
3. SnapCard's backend already has this endpoint implemented — it deletes the matching `ebay_accounts` row when eBay sends a deletion notification

### 6C: Update Environment Variables

Update these in both `backend/.env` and Railway:

```env
EBAY_APP_ID=your-production-client-id
EBAY_CERT_ID=your-production-client-secret
EBAY_REDIRECT_URI=Your_Production_RuName
EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
EBAY_MOCK_MODE=false
```

### 6D: Application Growth Check (if needed)

If eBay flags your app for review or you want to use restricted APIs:

1. Go to [Application Growth Check](https://developer.ebay.com/grow/application-growth-check)
2. Submit your app for review (3-5 business days)
3. eBay checks: latest API versions, error handling, efficient data usage

## Environment Variable Reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EBAY_APP_ID` | Yes | — | eBay Client ID |
| `EBAY_CERT_ID` | Yes | — | eBay Client Secret |
| `EBAY_DEV_ID` | Yes | — | eBay Developer ID |
| `EBAY_REDIRECT_URI` | Yes | — | OAuth RuName string |
| `EBAY_ENVIRONMENT` | Yes | `sandbox` | `sandbox` or `production` |
| `EBAY_SITE_ID` | No | `2` | eBay site (2 = Canada) |
| `EBAY_MOCK_MODE` | No | `false` | Skip real API calls when `true` |

**Mock mode** activates automatically when `EBAY_MOCK_MODE=true` OR `EBAY_APP_ID` is not set. In mock mode, OAuth returns fake tokens and publish creates mock eBay item IDs.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid redirect URI" during OAuth
- Verify the RuName string in `EBAY_REDIRECT_URI` matches exactly what's in the eBay developer portal
- Check that the Auth Accepted URL matches your frontend URL
- Sandbox and production RuNames are different — make sure you're using the right one

### "Token exchange failed" after OAuth callback
- Check that `EBAY_CERT_ID` is correct (this is the Client Secret, used for the Basic Auth header)
- Authorization codes expire quickly — the user may need to try the flow again

### OAuth works but publish fails
- Check the listing has all required fields: title, price, condition, at least one photo
- Verify `EBAY_SITE_ID` matches the eBay marketplace you want to list on
- Check the backend logs for the specific eBay error code and message

### "No eBay account linked" error
- The user needs to complete the OAuth flow before publishing
- Check Supabase `ebay_accounts` table — does a row exist for this user?

---

## How It Works (Technical Reference)

### OAuth Flow
1. Frontend calls `GET /api/auth/ebay-oauth-url`
2. Backend constructs eBay OAuth URL with scopes: `sell.inventory`, `sell.account`, `sell.fulfillment`
3. User approves on eBay → redirected to `/auth/ebay-callback?code=AUTH_CODE`
4. Frontend sends code to `POST /api/auth/ebay-callback`
5. Backend exchanges code for access + refresh tokens
6. Tokens stored in `ebay_accounts` table

### Token Management
- Access tokens auto-refresh when they expire within 5 minutes
- Refresh logic in `backend/src/services/ebay/tokenManager.ts`
- No user action needed — tokens stay valid indefinitely

### Publish Pipeline
1. User clicks Publish → `POST /api/listings/:id/publish`
2. Backend runs `VerifyAddItem` (dry run, checks for errors)
3. Listing status set to `scheduled` with 5-hour delay
4. Background job: uploads photos to eBay, calls `AddItem`, updates status to `published`
5. User gets email notification on success or failure

### Key Files
```
backend/src/services/ebay/
  config.ts          # URL switching, mock mode detection
  tokenManager.ts    # Token refresh logic
  trading.ts         # Trading API calls (AddItem, VerifyAddItem, etc.)
  publish.ts         # Publish scheduling and job logic
```
